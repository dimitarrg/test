Preheat your oven to 180 degrees C fan.
Roughly chop the beetroot into bite-size pieces and add to a baking tray, sprinkle with a good pinch of salt and a little drizzle of oil. Put the baking tray into the preheated oven for 25 minutes or until they are well roasted and slightly charred around the edges.
Drain and rinse the chickpeas and put in a pot of boiling water on a medium heat and cook for 10 minutes to warm up. Then drain the chickpeas.
Peel the garlic and add them into a food processor together with the roasted beetroot for the hummus, the drained chickpeas, the tahini, olive oil, juice of the lemon, ground cumin, 1 tsp of salt, half a tsp black pepper, 4 tbsp water and 4 tbsp oil and blend for about 2-3 minutes, until nice and smooth. Add a little more water if you think it needs it to reach your desired texture. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if you think it needs it.
Toast the pita breads and slice into dipping ‘fingers’.
Serve the hummus in a bowl on a large board with the toasted pitta breads and enjoy!
